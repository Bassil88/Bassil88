### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Bassil 
# just completed my Full-Stack Web Developer online course at DCI (Digital Career Institute) in Germany. started on October 2022 to December 2023.

### about me? hmm.. well:
I have a strong passion for challenges, which is why I enjoy doing parkour in my free time. Parkour is a demanding and difficult sport, but whenever I master a new movement or flip, it gives me an incredible feeling of accomplishment. Even during challenging moments when I push myself beyond my limits, I experience a rush of excitement and adrenaline, knowing that I'm about to achieve a new goal.

Interestingly, I've found a similar sense of satisfaction in coding. When I work with JavaScript or React and find the best and most efficient way to bring my ideas to life, seeing my code work and achieve the desired outcome makes me incredibly happy. It's like reaching a new milestone in my life and experiencing that same indescribable feeling of accomplishment.

My goal is to continue challenging myself both in parkour and coding, striving to master new movements in parkour and becoming proficient in advanced coding techniques. I believe that through constant growth and pushing my boundaries, I will achieve even greater goals and make meaningful contributions in both personal and professional domains.
